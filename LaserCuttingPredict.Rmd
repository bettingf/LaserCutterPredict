## Introduction

The application deals with the task of predicting the parameters that need to be used for a laser cutter, depending on the material to cut.

3 parameters need to be set on the Laser Cutter for a material :
* the cutting speed (denoted by speed)
* the minimum power the laser cutter has to use, for curves (denoted by minimum power)
* the maximum power the laser cutter has to use, for straight lines (denoted by maximum power)

The application simplifies the task of setting those parameters by keeping parameters from previously cut materials and predicting parameters for new materials.
